# xMINT: A Multimodal Integration Transformer for Xenium Gene Imputation

## Getting Started

This repository contains the implementation of the paper available on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hnYLq2lwOv).

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Create a Python 3.8 environment.
2. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
python -m venv xmint_env
source xmint_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Input Data Format

You will need paired Xenium datasets from the same tissue to get started.

For each dataset, the input data should include:

1. **Xenium Output Bundle**: The data generated by Xenium.
2. **Post-Xenium H&E Image**: An OME-TIFF file of the H&E stained image corresponding to the Xenium output.

Unzip the Xenium Output Bundle folder and place the H&E image into the output folder.

## Pipeline

To run the pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Run the preprocessing script:

```bash
python preprocess_to_sequence.py
```

2. Run the main xMINT script:

```bash
python xmint_main.py
```

Before running these scripts, ensure you update the sample names and other customized parameters as needed.
